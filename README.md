# Reverse an Array
Code challenge to reverse array 

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
Create a function that starts at the end of the array and loops through to the beginning, pushing each value to a new array. This seemed like the simplest and most efficient way to complete the challenge without too many steps and repetition.

# Shift Array
Code challenge to add value to the middle of an array

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.
